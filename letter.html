<h2>My love,</h2>

<p>
I love you with all my heart.  
I know things are sometimes messy. We couldn’t handle some problems, and sometimes you struggle with my moods and emotions. I know it hasn’t been easy, and I want you to know that I’m still in my healing phase — and I’m really, truly trying.
</p>

<p>
I promise I will keep trying, every day, to make you happy.  
I hope I bring you the same happiness and peace that you bring into my life.
</p>

<p>
I want to see you achieve every dream you carry in your heart and be truly happy.  
Even if I may not always walk beside you in your successes, I promise to walk with you through every struggle. I will be your strength, just as you have been mine.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for being my biggest supporter, for standing by me, and for making me feel loved and happy.  
I wish that next year, on Valentine’s Day, we are much closer to our dreams and our goals.
</p>

<p>
I love you — today, tomorrow, and forever.  
I hope you know how deeply I love you.
</p>

<p>
To my boy,<br>
I love you.<br>
Happy Valentine’s Day 🫂🫂🫂
